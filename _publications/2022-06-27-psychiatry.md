## Objective
The objectives of this study were to examine the prevalence of burnout, specify contributors to and protective factors against burnout, and gather suggestions to improve well-being in psychiatry Program Directors.

## Methods
A survey regarding burnout and wellness was distributed to psychiatric Program Directors through the email listserv of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training (AADPRT).

## Results
The survey response rate was 273 responses out of 880 members surveyed (31%). The majority of respondents were current residency or fellowship Program Directors or Associate Program Directors or had another current educational role (93%, 227/245). Almost half of current Program Directors or Associate Program Directors reported feeling burned out almost daily or once a week (44%, 93/210). These Program Directors reported a desire to resign (77%), experienced discrimination within the past 5 years (66%), and struggled with finding meaning in their job (44%). The most frequently endorsed contributors to burnout were increasing administrative burden and insufficient support.

## Conclusions
The survey findings confirm that burnout characteristics are common among respondents, associated with a desire to resign and a struggle to find meaning in the highly demanding position of Program Director or Associate Program Director. Advocacy for resources, decreased administrative overload, and increased protected time would enhance well-being in Program Directors. Most striking was the frequency of discrimination reported and its relationship to burnout. Departments may benefit from a careful review of policies, procedures, and training to decrease hostile workplaces for women, international medical graduate, and under-represented in medicine Program Directors.
